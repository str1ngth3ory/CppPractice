basic data structure and algorithm implementation with c++

This is a practice implementation of the linked list data structurre i wrote before. I added .sort(), .swap(), and .swapNode() per your request. I don't remember what exactly you wanted for the swap method so I included two different swap methods. Thanks for reviewing.
